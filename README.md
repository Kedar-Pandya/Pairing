## Application Infrastructure  

I used the most fundamental design pattern MVC which is a choice of an American multinational technology company Apple. MVC stands for model-view-controller, in this design pattern the application was split into three main components. 
Workflow of MVC-based application like this:

![traditional_mvc](https://github.com/Kedar-Pandya/Pairing/assets/64677824/b798d498-5fdd-4430-b0de-8c35515de387)

The workflow starts with View, while a user interacts with the help of UI view sends the message to the controller. Controllers work as a mediator in MVC architecture, controllers generate a request of that action which was given by view and delivered to the model. All the logical and database operations are handled in the Model component. As per request model send the data to the controller and the controller modifies that and provides the output to the view.
